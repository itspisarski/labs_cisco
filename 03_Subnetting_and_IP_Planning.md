# Lab 03 – Subnetting and IP Planning

**Objective:** Plan and configure subnetted IPv4 networks.

### 🧩 Topology
Router1 — Router2 — Router3 (Triangle)

### ⚙️ Steps
1. Divide `192.168.50.0/24` into four `/26` subnets.
2. Assign subnets between routers.
3. Configure interfaces using CLI.
4. Verify with `show ip interface brief`.
5. Enable static routes between routers.

### 🔍 Verification
- Routers can reach each other.
- Each subnet uses correct mask.

### 💡 Reflection
- How many hosts per subnet?
- What if you used `/27` instead?
